Rummy

A small project with the sole goal to be able to play rummy in class, online, without cards, and without the teacher noticing.
It is nowhere near complete, not even feature-complete.

"Features" already implemented:
  Locally playable on the same computer
  an interactive cli-like shell to interact with the game
  most of the regular game's features (there are quite big exceptions, still)
  
Planned features:
  Being stable
  multiple-deal games
  savestates
  actual multiplayer
  round resetting to prevent softlocks
  
  I guess that's it
